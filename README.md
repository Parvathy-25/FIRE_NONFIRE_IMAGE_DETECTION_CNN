# FIRE_NONFIRE_IMAGE_DETECTION_CNN
This project focuses on classifying images as fire or non-fire using deep learning techniques. Images are processed and trained using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically detect the presence of forest fires, enabling early warning and improved wildfire monitoring.
